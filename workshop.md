# Craft a Basic CLI App using NodeJS

Ever wondered how commands in terminal (like `cd`, `ls` ) are written?
Did you ever want to make an app that can run directly in  your terminal or command prompt?
This workshop will serve as a great starter to make CLI _(short for Command Line Interface)_ apps!

## What will we be making? ü§î

Let's make an app that fetches jokes? 
Because who doesn't like jokes?

![A gif that says no idea](https://cloud-grdpgs1h5.vercel.app/0giphy.gif)

You wanna see how the final app looks? Here's the [link](https://uwu.aaryanporwal.repl.run/) to the live demo, and here's the [link](https://repl.it/@aaryanporwal/uwu) to the source code.

## Part 1: The Prerequisites

You need to have a beginner level understanding of how things work in:

- Javascript
- NodeJS

That's it!

## Part 2: The Setup

You can either do this workshop in your terminal (in MacOS/Linux), Command Prompt (in Windows), or online on [Repl.it](https://repl.it).
Doing this workshop on terminal or command prompt is preferred, but Repl.it works great too! (For this workshop I'll be using repl.it)
So let's begin üöÄ !

Head over to repl.it and follow the steps to spin up your environment:

![Click on start coding](https://cloud-anvhhtdg5.vercel.app/0image.png)

![Select bash from language dropdown and click on create repl](https://cloud-iztsipr4g.vercel.app/0image.png)

Hooray!! Your repl instance is now up! You might see a similar screen:

![repl environment photo](https://cloud-p5pvtbzdd.vercel.app/0image.png)

## Part 3: Building the App

1. Add a new file from the left pane, with name: `<your super cool app name>.js` (without the brackets though).

2. In _repl.it_'s terminal (the black sidebar) type `npm init -y` to initialize the project (It'll generate a package.json file).

3. In the first line of your javascript file, type: `#!/usr/bin/env node` to tell repl.it (or your OS) that this file is to be run by _**node**_. This line is also called a shebang or a hashbang.

4. Now to check if everything is working fine, in your js file, type:

    ```javascript
    console.log('Hack Club is awesome!')
    ```   

5. Execute the app by typing `node <your-app-name>.js` in your terminal.

    You should see the something like this:
    ![console.log() returns the statement](https://cloud-387cmkqc6.vercel.app/0image.png)
    Where the string inside the _console.log_ function is printed in the terminal

>Note: In future whenever you want to execute the app we'll use the same syntax used in point number 5.

## Part 4: Add Support for Command Line Arguments

Most CLI applications accept one or more command line arguments, such as optional/required parameters, commands, flags/switches, or other configuration values. Although you can _parse_ command line parameters by inspecting the Node.js `process.argv value`, there are modules available that will save you a lot of time and effort. 
The `yargs` module is one such module for Node.js designed to support the most common CLI scenarios.

1. First, install the yargs module as a dependency for your application, for that in your terminal type:

    ```bash
    npm install yargs
    ```

2. Next, update your javascript file with the following code:

   ```javascript
   #!/usr/bin/env node

   const yargs = require("yargs");

   const options = yargs
    .usage("Usage: -n <name>")
    .option("n", { alias: "name", describe: "Your name", type: "string", demandOption: true })
    .argv;

   const greeting = `Hello, ${options.name}üëã \n`;

   console.log(greeting);
   ```

Code Explanation:
We want our super awesome app to greet the user, for that our app will require a `name` attribute. That's what the code does, it imports yargs module, and then we define the `help` page of our app and ask for `name` attribute, after taking the `name` attribute, our app will greets the user.

>Note: The yargs module automatically builds a great response for displaying help! Your CLI is not only ready to accept `-n` and `--name` arguments but also `--help` and `--version`. Try running your CLI application with any of the above arguments!

So try running our code so far by executing `node <your app name.js> -n <your name>`


### Our App So Far

![Code preview](https://cloud-fwazdes5p.vercel.app/0image.png)

Your screen should look similar! If it does, Hooray! You made your own nodejs application!

But our app doesn't do a lot of stuff right now, so let's get to the next part!!

## Part 5: Call API from the Command Line

In this part of the tutorial, we are going to fetch a random joke from a joke API and display it in the console, sounds fun, right?

![gif saying awesome!](https://cloud-9w3yv7xjz.vercel.app/0awesome-yes.webp)

One of the most popular libraries for retrieving and sending data to an API in Node.js is [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios). Start by adding axios as a dependency:

```bash
node install axios
```

Next, replace the contents of your javascript file with the following code.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const yargs = require("yargs");
const axios = require("axios");

const options = yargs
 .usage("Usage: -n <name>")
 .option("n", { alias: "name", describe: "Your name", type: "string", demandOption: true })
 .argv;

const greeting = `Hello, ${options.name}üëã \n`;
console.log(greeting);

console.log("Here's a random joke for you:");

const url = "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/";

axios.get(url, { headers: { Accept: "application/json" } })
 .then(res => {
   console.log(res.data.joke);
 });
```

![what's happening](https://cloud-h0r4eewr9.vercel.app/0whats-happening.gif)

**Code Explanation:**

In addition to responding with a greeting, the CLI application will now retrieve a random joke from the website's [API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) using axios and display it immediately after the greeting. We'll take a look at how this works in a minute.

**_How does the app look now ü§î ?_**

![random joke functionality](https://cloud-3wip6rf0e.vercel.app/0image.png)

_Pretty cool, right?_

![Oh yes gif](https://cloud-3sjs1qqpt.vercel.app/0oh-yes.gif)

## Optional Part A: Adding Search Feature

For this lovely feature, we'll add another argument: `--search` or `-s` in short. For this we'll summon our _Yargs_ module again üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è !

Now let's update our javascript file again with the following code:

```javascript

#!/usr/bin/env node

const yargs = require("yargs");
const axios = require("axios");

const options = yargs
 .usage("Usage: -n <name>")
 .option("n", { alias: "name", describe: "Your name", type: "string", demandOption: true })
 .option("s", { alias: "search", describe: "Search term", type: "string" })
 .argv;

const greeting = `Hello, ${options.name}üëã \n`;
console.log(greeting);

if (options.search) {
 console.log(`Searching for jokes about ${options.search}...`)
} else {
 console.log("Here's a random joke for you:");
}

// The url depends on whether user is searching or not!
const url = options.search ? `https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=${options.search}` : "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/";

axios.get(url, { headers: { Accept: "application/json" } })
 .then(res => {
   if (options.search) {
        //if searching for jokes, loop over the results, where j is an iterator and \n is a newline character
     res.data.results.forEach( j => {
       console.log("\n" + j.joke);
     });
     if (res.data.results.length === 0) {
       console.log("no jokes found :'(");
     }
   } else {
     console.log(res.data.joke);
   }
 });
```

Now, where did the above code come from? 
The website API allows us to do a lot of cool stuff, one of which is searching for a specific keyword from their database of jokes. To read more about how their API works and all the other cool stuff you can do, refer [this](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) documentation.

## Where Can You Go From Here?

There are of course a lot of things that you can hack together in your app, but here are some points to ponder:

1. How to make our app look pretty ‚ú® 

2. Use the API documentation to add more features and to make it more powerful üí™ .

3. How to publish your npm package, for this - checkout one of our hack clubber's awesome workshop [here](https://workshops.hackclub.com/firstnpmpackage/) üöÄ .

### How To Make Our App Look Pretty?

Let's take a look at two super cute libraries that you can add to our app:

1. [Chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk): To format your text with colors, underlines, bold, italics and so much more

2. [Boxen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boxen): Add all your text in a box!!

Now try to implement both of them in your app, first try on your own using the documentation, but if you fail to do so, or you want some inspiration:

[Take a look here](https://repl.it/@aaryanporwal/chalk-boxen#joke-genie.js)

### API Documentation

Take a look at the docs [here](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) and try to add more features! _Psst.. you can fetch the jokes as an image too!!!_
